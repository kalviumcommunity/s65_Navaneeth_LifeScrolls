# üìñ LifeScrolls ‚Äì AI-Powered Memory Book

**LifeScrolls** is a Generative AI-powered digital diary that transforms personal memories, diary entries, or life events into beautifully written stories, summaries, and quotes.  

It works like a **memory capsule** ‚Äì preserving special life moments in a narrative form. Users can input text about an event (e.g., a trip, birthday, or achievement), and the AI will:  

- Summarize it concisely  
- Generate a story-like narrative  
- Suggest emotional quotes or captions  
- Create creative event titles  
- Export everything into a structured **Memory Book (PDF/HTML)**

## üìå Example Workflow

### User Input
```text
We went to Goa last December, enjoyed the beach, did parasailing, and celebrated Christmas together.


AI Output

Summary:
A Christmas getaway in Goa filled with adventure and joy.

Story:
In December 2023, our family embarked on a memorable trip to Goa. Between parasailing above the waves and Christmas celebrations on the beach, it became a chapter of laughter, togetherness, and sunshine.

Quote:
‚ÄúThe ocean keeps our laughter safe in its waves.‚Äù

Title:
Waves of December



### üõ†Ô∏è System and User Prompt (RTFC Framework)

In this task, we designed **System and User Prompts** tailored to the LifeChapters use case.  
We applied the **RTFC Framework** (Role, Task, Format, Context) to structure the prompts clearly:  

- **Role**: Define the AI as a memory storyteller.  
- **Task**: Summarize, expand, and generate creative titles/quotes for memories.  
- **Format**: Output in structured JSON/Markdown for clean rendering.  
- **Context**: Use user-provided diary entries or events as input.  

This ensures the prompts are consistent, reliable, and aligned with the project‚Äôs goals.


### üéØ Zero-Shot Prompting

In this task, we applied **Zero-Shot Prompting** within the LifeChapters project.  
Zero-Shot Prompting means giving the AI **only an instruction without examples**, and expecting it to generate the desired output.  

For LifeChapters, the AI was prompted to:  
- Take a raw memory input from the user.  
- Directly generate a summary, story, quote, and title.  

This method tests the model‚Äôs **generalization ability** without relying on prior demonstrations.  
It ensures flexibility when handling completely new types of memory inputs.



### üìù One-Shot Prompting  

In this task, we implemented **One-Shot Prompting** for the LifeChapters project.  
One-Shot Prompting means we provide the AI with **a single example** of the expected input and output format, before asking it to perform the same task on a new input.  

This approach helps guide the AI more clearly than Zero-Shot, since it gets one demonstration of what the output should look like. It sets a pattern that the AI can then replicate with the user‚Äôs own memory input.  

For LifeChapters, we gave the AI one memory input as an example and showed how it should generate:  
- A short **summary** of the memory  
- An expanded **story version**  
- A **quote or caption** to capture the emotion  
- A creative **title** for the event  

After providing this demonstration, we then asked the AI to do the same task for a completely new memory provided by the user. This improves **consistency, formatting, and quality** of the results compared to Zero-Shot Prompting.  

Thus, One-Shot Prompting ensures the AI understands the **style, tone, and structure** of the desired response with only one guiding example.
